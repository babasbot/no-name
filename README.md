# no-name

> ðŸš§ This game is a work in progress.

In this rogue-like adventure game, players will take on the role of a nameless
hero embarking on a dangerous journey through treacherous dungeons and
challenging enemies. With randomly generated levels and unpredictable obstacles,
each playthrough offers a unique experience.

The hero starts with no name, but as players progress through the game and
complete it or die, they will have the opportunity to give their hero a name
that will be forever remembered in the game's leaderboard.

The game features a variety of weapons and spells to master, and players must
strategically manage their resources and make quick decisions to survive.

Can you make it to the end and earn the right to name your hero?
